OS Project 4A Simple Linux Shell

To compile and run:
1. Navigate to the folder with the myshell.c file in a terminal
2. To make type: make
3. To run type: ./a.out
================================================================================
To use this shell:
Linux commands should work when you see my prompt: linux (cws26)|>
There are new commands that work as aliases to existing commands (listed below)
This prompt should act like a normal Linux prompt.
All functionality should be included and working as intended for this project.
Also, a few files have been provided to test copy and deleting a file.
These files are file1 and file2.
================================================================================
Functions myshell contains:
int parseCommand(char *, struct command_t *);
void printPrompt();
void readCommand(char *);
int main(int argc, char *argv[]);

Functionality of myshell has compatible commands:
C file1 file2       Copies file1 to new file file2
D file1             Removes file called file1
E Some message.     Prints "Some message." to screen
H                   Displays this help page
L                   List the contents of the current directory
M file1             Create file file1 by launching a text editor
P file1             Display the contents of file1 on screen
Q                   Quit the shell
S                   Surf the web by launching a browser in the backgrond
W                   Clears the screen and wipes it
X program1          Execute a program called program1
================================================================================
Citations:
For the firefox command to run without printing errors to the screen and working
in the background, a special command was need to execute since the warnings were
from stderror instead of stdout. A graduate student named Cory showed me how to
supress these warnings with the following command: firefox > /dev/null 2>&1 &

Other than this, all work was original on this project. Everything should be
included and work as intended. If anything is missing or needs corrected, please
let me know so I can adjust it accordingly.
